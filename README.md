# Flipbook

## Introduction

"Gremlins came in the night and reversed the order of the words in all of our books! They also stole the split function from our standard Ruby library! Can you help us?"

## Usage

Using the standard library, the flipbook method would accomplish the same thing as this line of Ruby:

```book_string.split(" ").reverse.join(" ")```

The intent is to accomplish the same output without using any of the above functions, and hopefully to improve on efficiency in the process.
